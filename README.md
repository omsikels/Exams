It is designed to administer secure exams while simultaneously recording and analyzing student facial expressions and emotions to monitor testing integrity.🌟 What Does This Platform Do?ExperienceDescription🧑‍🎓 The StudentStudents log in and take a timed, multiple-choice exam. The system securely records their webcam feed in the background. The video is chunked and saved directly to the server, organized neatly by the student's name.👨‍💻 The AdminAdministrators have access to a secure dashboard to manage exam questions, view student directories, and run the Enhanced Facial Recognition engine. The admin panel processes the videos to generate statistical emotion timelines.🤖 Machine Learning ArchitectureTo monitor student behavior, this platform utilizes a custom-built Neural Keypoint Features (NKF) Deep Learning model. Instead of just looking at the whole face, it specifically tracks the movement of microscopic facial muscles.The 4-Stage AI PipelineStageProcessTechnology Used1Face Detection: Locates and crops the student's face from the video frames.OpenCV (Haar Cascades)2Landmark Alignment: Maps exactly 68 distinct facial landmarks (eyes, nose, mouth corners, jawline) on the student's face.FAN / MobileFaceNet3Feature Extraction: Extracts global image features, focusing specifically on how those 68 landmarks are moving.ResNet50 & RKFA4Classification: Combines features to classify the expression into one of 7 core emotions.PyTorch TensorsSupported Emotion Classifications:🟢 Happiness | 🔵 Neutral | 🟡 Surprise | 🟠 Sadness | 🔴 Anger | 🟣 Fear | 🟤 Disgust🚀 Getting Started (How to Run)We have built a fully automated startup script. You do not need to use the command line or manually install software.Running the ApplicationOpen the main project folder in File Explorer.Double-click the <kbd>Start_Exam_System.bat</kbd> file.Allow Administrator Privileges: The script will ask for Admin rights. Click <kbd>Yes</kbd>.Wait: The script will automatically install Node.js, Python, and all required AI dependencies (PyTorch, OpenCV, etc.).Ready! The script will automatically open your web browser to the correct portals.🔐 System AccessOnce the startup script finishes, the following URLs will be automatically available:📝 Student Exam Portal: http://localhost:3000/index.html⚙️ Admin Login Portal: http://localhost:3000/login.htmlDefault Admin Credentials:Username: admin Password: exam3000📁 Advanced Info: Directory Structure<details><summary><b>🖱️ Click to expand the folder architecture</b></summary>Below is the visual map of how the system organizes data and logic:Plaintext📦 Exam3000-Project
